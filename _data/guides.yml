  description:
    You may have noticed that many GIS datasets contain information about
    a geographic extent that is larger than your area of interest. Your research may
    involve analysis of data related to a single municipality in Ontario, yet you
    have only been able to locate a dataset showing all municipalities located within
    the province. Alternatively, you may be interested in only displaying a selection
    of features on your completed map, such as the Canadian cities you have selected
    as case studies for your research. This tutorial will demonstrate how to extract
    just the features you need from larger datasets, saving them to new files that
    you can then use to map and analyze your data.

    can be used in terrain analysis, SD visualizations and hydrological modelling,
    among other applications. DEMs can be stored in several different formats; however,
    conversion into a raster dataset is often required for many processes. This tutorial

    About this workshop 
    
    **What**: This is a beginner to intermediate tutorial, that will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of the uses and types of data
    that can be manipulated in Excel, an extremely popular spreadsheet software. Through
    practical exercises using real world data from the Toronto Transit Commission
    (TTC), you will learn important terminology and software features, and gain a
    better understanding of Excel’s built-in methods for data manipulation and cleaning,
    as well as analysis and visualization. 
  
    **Why**: Excel is a popular spreadsheet software
    that allows you to organize, modify and analyze your data. It remains one of the
    most widely used software for data analytics. A deeper understanding of Excel
    will help you better navigate the tool to work with your data sets, in the classroom
    and beyond. 

    **Who**: This tutorial assumes you have used Excel before at a basic level,
    but haven’t explored all it has to offer. There are no prerequisites or assumptions
    of knowledge of math, statistics, or programming! 

    **Software**: Excel is freely available for
    download for University of Toronto staff, faculty and students. Note: This tutorial
    is intended for Mac users. If you are using Windows, check out this tutorial instead. 
    
    **Code of Conduct**: Map & Data Library (MDL) workshops are a welcoming and inclusive environment
    for learning. To learn more, check out ourCode of Conduct.

    *"This tutorial has been developed for OpenRefine version 3.7.5 Update:
    please note that as of March 18, 2020, Open Data Toronto has suspended service
    and so their service is not available for API calls. Until service resumes, please
    skip step 3, and during step 5, please chose to Get Data From: This Computer and
    select the 311.json file in the packaged workshop files. This represents a snapshot
    of the data that will work with the exercises. Please feel free to email mdl@library.utoronto.ca if
    you run into difficulties.* Sometimes you don't have your data in a file. Instead
    you want to use an API call to pull data from elsewhere. OpenRefine can help you
    make these calls and parse the data you receive.The goal of this activity is to
    create a new project by pulling in 311 call data from the City of Toronto into
    OpenRefine using an API call and then work with the data. You will construct an
    API call to download a subset of 311 call data in JSON format, and then use OpenRefine
    to parse that data and put it into a tabular format. You will then use GREL to
    further manipulate the data (especially working with date formats) and make some
    discoveries.***Note:*** *This assumes that you have learned the basics of OpenRefine already
    through [the Survey of Household Spending activity](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-1-survey-household-spending-activity) and the [Citizen Science activity](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-2-citizen-science-activity).

  description:
    *This tutorial has been developed for OpenRefine version 3.7.5*
    
    You were introduced to GREL in the previous activity, so you know that GREL is a powerful
    tool for cleaning/editing your data. You can make GREL even more powerful by learning
    how to use regular expressions (aka regex). A regular expression is a sequence
    of characters that define a search pattern – it is used to search for matches
    within text. In OpenRefine, you can use it in your GREL expressions to create
    sophisticated patterns describing what type of information you want to find within
    your dataset, then do something with the matching text (edit it, delete it, put
    it in a new column, etc.). This activity assumes you have already completed the [Survey
    of Household Spending](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-1-survey-household-spending-activity) and [Citizen Science](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-2-citizen-science-activity) activities, have a familiarity with OpenRefine
    and know how to create simple GREL expressions. Before you begin, please download

    captured for a city nature challenge and shared on [data.world](https://data.world/). This activity will
    showcase some more features in OpenRefine.The goal of this activity is to create
    a new project with this citizen science dataset and work with the data. You will
    use clustering to improve the consistency of the dataset. You will also perform
    various manipulations, such as split and concatenate. Finally, you will learn
    various ways to remove columns and rows, and work with the Undo/Redo features
    in OpenRefine. Before you begin, please download the OpenRefine workshop sample

    course](http://q.utoronto.ca/enroll/E4JKAW).This is the first activity in this tutorial series, and assumes no prior
    knowledge of OpenRefine. In this activity you will be importing a spreadsheet
    of data into OpenRefine and exploring it. The goal of this activity is to use
    a simple dataset to introduce you to the OpenRefine user interface and some of
    the basic types of tasks you can accomplish. This dataset isn’t particularly “messy,”
    but provides some of the core knowledge needed to work with messier datasets in
    later activities. If you need a copy of OpenRefine on your personal computer, please
    follow these [installation instructions](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-installation-instructions). 
    
    Before you begin, please download the OpenRefine workshop sample datasets (https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/datapub/workshops/OpenRefineWorkshop.zip).
