  description: You may have noticed that many GIS datasets contain information about
    a geographic extent that is larger than your area of interest. Your research may
    involve analysis of data related to a single municipality in Ontario, yet you
    have only been able to locate a dataset showing all municipalities located within
    the province. Alternatively, you may be interested in only displaying a selection
    of features on your completed map, such as the Canadian cities you have selected
    as case studies for your research. This tutorial will demonstrate how to extract
    just the features you need from larger datasets, saving them to new files that
    you can then use to map and analyze your data.

  description: 'This tutorial has been developed for OpenRefine version 3.7.5Update:
    please note that as of March 18, 2020, Open Data Toronto has suspended service
    and so their service is not available for API calls. Until service resumes, please
    skip step 3, and during step 5, please chose to Get Data From: This Computer and
    select the 311.json file in the packaged workshop files. This represents a snapshot
    of the data that will work with the exercises. Please feel free to emailmdl@library.utoronto.caif
    you run into difficulties.Sometimes you don''t have your data in a file. Instead
    you want to use an API call to pull data from elsewhere. OpenRefine can help you
    make these calls and parse the data you receive.The goal of this activity is to
    create a new project by pulling in 311 call data from the City of Toronto into
    OpenRefine using an API call and then work with the data. You will construct an
    API call to download a subset of 311 call data in JSON format, and then use OpenRefine
    to parse that data and put it into a tabular format. You will then use GREL to
    further manipulate the data (especially working with date formats) and make some
    discoveries.Note:This assumes that you have learned the basics of OpenRefine already
    through theSurvey of Household Spending activityand theCitizen Science activity.
    This also assumes that you have a basic understanding ofAPIsandJSON.The 311 JSON
    dataset can be found in thesample datain case the API call does not work.'

  url: https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-3-regular-expressions-regex-activity
  description: This tutorial has been developed for OpenRefine version 3.7.5You were
    introduced to GREL in the previous activity, so you know that GREL is a powerful
    tool for cleaning/editing your data. You can make GREL even more powerful by learning
    how to use regular expressions (aka regex). A regular expression is a sequence
    of characters that define a search pattern – it is used to search for matches
    within text. In OpenRefine, you can use it in your GREL expressions to create
    sophisticated patterns describing what type of information you want to find within
    your dataset, then do something with the matching text (edit it, delete it, put
    it in a new column, etc.).This activity assumes you have already completed theSurvey
    of Household SpendingandCitizen Scienceactivities, have a familiarity with OpenRefine
    and know how to create simple GREL expressions. Before you begin, please download
    theOpenRefine workshop sample datasets, if you have not already.

    showcase some more features in OpenRefine.The goal of this activity is to create
    a new project with this citizen science dataset and work with the data. You will
    use clustering to improve the consistency of the dataset. You will also perform
    various manipulations, such as split and concatenate. Finally, you will learn
    various ways to remove columns and rows, and work with the Undo/Redo features
    in OpenRefine.Before you begin, please download theOpenRefine workshop sample
